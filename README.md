Sisqó is a member of Dru Hill, a contemporary R&B group from Baltimore, Maryland who arrived on the scene in 1996 with their hit single “Tell Me.” His “signature” melisma or vocal run, for which he sings a descending set of five notes on the single-syllable word “yeah,” begins to emerge during Dru Hill’s second group album, called Enter the Dru. The single “How Deep Is Your Love,” featured on the soundtrack for 1998’s incredibly popular Rush Hour 2 begins with Sisqó’s signature melisma, and in his soulful, full, almost shouting voice, he unleashes this melismatic sequence to announce his presence and singing style. Throughout the song, he repeats this melismatic line six more times, reinforcing that opening song moment as something to listen out for in the future. Sisqó creates an anticipatory feeling in listeners as we come to expect to hear his specific melisma more in other songs. From a marketing standpoint, Sisqó, like Hip Hop producers of the current musical landscape who include their recorded producer tags at the start of a song thy produced, was in 1999 making his musical persona known with memorable, sonic line that became his signature. He used this signature to create both anticipation and continuity in his music, where the listener could expect to hear his signature run on most songs he was making (or featured on) during this period of his career.
